# coop-fd

This is a simple accounting server for me and my roommates to keep track
of our shared purchases. It uses multiple data providers to retrieve
receipt contents and stores it using the official binary format.

I will add or remove supported providers depending on my needs.

Some of the features don't have a UI, because I wrote a
[maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) plugin for using these.
